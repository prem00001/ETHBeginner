This Solidity smart contract creates a simple token system that includes a mapping to manage balances and public variables for token data (token name, token abbreviation, and total supply). To ensure balance checks for safe transactions, it has two functions: Mint, which assigns balance to newly created tokens, and Burn, through which we can burn the balance of tokens and get the remaining balance.
